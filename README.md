# Todo
* Optimize the CPU network to use boolean operations, as well as potentially other NNUE derived tricks
* Optimize the GPU network calls so that at least a few hundred can run per second
* Enable multithreading for the MCTS
* Enable multithreading for compare
* Enabling generating games from multiple nets/evaluators
* Tournament system to determine which networks are used to generate training games
